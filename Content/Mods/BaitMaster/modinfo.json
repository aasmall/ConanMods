	"description": "This mod reintroduces passive fish generation.\n\nI don't actually know what the original tick rate was, so I settled on the same rate the beehives use which is 1 fish every 120 seconds. Passive generation is based on the \"insects\" spawn weight, so you'll mostly get unappetizing fish.\n",
